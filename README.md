# interview_coding_exercise
A coding exercise which uses a node api and react SPA to display users, posts and comments

# Pre-Requesites
* Ensure you have node installed
* Have yarn installed (you may also use npm instead)

# Server
NB: The following instructions apply when you are in the `server` directory

## To run
To run the server first make sure it has been transpiled using `yarn build`. If you are using `npm` run `npm run build`

To transpile and run the server in one go, run `yarn restart`

## To run the tests
Ensure the server is first transpiled and running, and then in a different terminal run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.
